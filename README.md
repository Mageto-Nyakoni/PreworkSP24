## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Levels (Social Media Workout Tracker):
    - I love the interactability with friends!
    - The progresssion system after every workout makes me feel accomplished
- Duolingo
    - I like the friendly reminders the app provides to logging in
    - love the cute little widget to remind me to renew my streak
    - the UI is very simple and aesthetically pleasing
- Maps
    - I like the interaction with the dynamic islands when possible
    - The use of teh always on display is cool, so you always know where you're going
    - the audio as well as visual cues are nice!

I would love to create a personal audiojournalling app to rreflect on books, media and serve as a journal for myself, as I prefer audiojournalling to
traditional written forms of journalling. maybe implement a streak feature and a notification as a reminder to login every day, as well as an award system to 
incentivize reflection on a daily basis.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
I had issues seeing the color being randomized while running the program, as well as linking the button to the code, however playing around
for a while and closing xcode ultimatley lead to the results I needed
